# Example distribution configuration
#
DISTRO="template"

# Use the same chroot as another distro; for e.g. `jessie-bleeding`
# repos
#
#DISTRO_NAME[$DISTRO]="jessie"

# List of packages to build for this distribution
#
# Package names come from the file names (less the `.sh` suffix) in
# the `/scripts/package` directory. Attempting to build a package not
# in this list will result in an error.
#
DISTRO_PACKAGES[$DISTRO]="mypkg another-pkg"

# Apt package repositories to configure for this distribution
#
# Repo names come from the file names (less the `.sh` suffix) in the
# `/scripts/repo` directory. The first listed distro that matches the
# build architecture is used as the 'base' distro.
#
DISTRO_REPOS[$DISTRO]="debian 3rd-party-repo"

# Codename
#
# The default codename is the distro name, from the name of this file.
# In most cases this is unnecessary.
#
#DISTRO_CODENAME[$DISTRO]="jessie"

# Distro architectures
#
# The default list of architectures comes from the `base-config.sh`
# script `ARCHES` parameter.  In most cases this is unnecessary.
#
#DISTRO_ARCHES[$DISTRO]="armhf"

# Build options
#
# Don't attempt to cross-build on this distro (e.g. cross-build tools
# unavailable)
#
#DISTRO_NATIVE_BUILD_ONLY[$DISTRO]="true"

# Create separate apt repository directory
#
# Distro repositories usually share a repository directory, and thus a
# URL. However, when two distros share the same codename and Debian
# architecture name but not packages, repository paths conflict. When
# this option is set, the local apt repository will be created in
# 'repo/$DISTRO' rather than just 'repo'.
#
# DISTRO_SEPARATE_REPO_DIR[$DISTRO]="true"
